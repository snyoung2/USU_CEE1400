In some sense, the function is defined in terms of itself. Recursion falls under a category of algorithms called “divide and conquer”, in which a problem is broken down into smaller sub-problems that are easier to solve. These subproblems are solved individually, and the final result is the culmination of these results of all these subproblems.\n","\n","In other words, if you write a function that performs a certain task by calling itself, the function is called a recursive function, and this process is called recursion."],"metadata":{"id":"zL_POSVu_ox9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Flawed recursion\n","\n","Consider the recursive function below.
